Project Description
The "Fake Holiday Calendar" is a fun, interactive, and colorful website designed to prank friends by showing random fake holidays with hilarious pop-up messages. These pop-ups appear when you click on a holiday and disappear automatically after a few seconds, or when you click anywhere on the screen. Along with pranks, the site also lets users set personal reminders, making it a blend of entertainment and utility.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Everyone gets bored of the same old boring calendar holidays. Who knew April 12th was ‚ÄúTalk Like a Dinosaur Day‚Äù? Nobody! Your friends are missing out on daily doses of random hilarity.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Fake Holiday Calendar‚Äîa colorful, interactive website that pranks your friends with random fake holidays. Click a holiday and enjoy a hilarious pop-up message that disappears after a few seconds. Bonus: you can set personal reminders too, because even pranks need planning.
